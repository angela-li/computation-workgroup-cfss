# Primer on the course

#### Origins

* Pre-2016
* Adapted from Jenny Bryan's [Stat 545](https://stat545.com/)

--

#### Core objectives

* Fulfill programming requirement for certificate in computational social science
* Introduce graduate/undergraduate students to programming techniques essential for CSS

# Lessons learned

* Everyone is capable of learning given sufficient resources
* Set expectations high and (most) students rise to the challenge
* As enrollment expands, automate where you can **if it is pedagogically sound**
* Tidy or base R? Good question!
